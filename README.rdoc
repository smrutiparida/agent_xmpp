= Agent XMPP

Agent XMPP is a simple DSL for writing XMPP automated clients that support Messaging, Ad-Hoc Commands and Publish Subscribe 
Events. An application that responds to an Ad-Hoc command can be written with few lines of code.

    # myapp.rb
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'agent_xmpp'

    execute 'hello' do
      'Hello World' 
    end

Specify the application Jabber ID (JID), password and roster in +agent_xmpp.yml+.

    jid: myapp@nowhere.com
    password: pass
    roster:
        - 
            jid:you@home.com
        - 
            jid: someone@somewhere.com

Install the gem and run

    sudo gem install troystribling-agent_xmpp --source=http://gems.github.com
    ruby myapp.rb

Install the Gajim XMPP Client, http://www.gajim.org, and connect to _you@home.com_.

When started for the first time +myapp.rb+ will automatically send buddy requests to all contacts specified
in +agent_xmpp.yml+. Accept the buddy request and _myapp_ will appear as a contact in the Gajim roster. Right click on _myapp_
in the roster and select _execute commands_. _hello_ will be in the list of Ad-Hoc Commands. Select _hello_ from the 
list and click the _forward_ _button_ to execute _hello_.

== Ad-Hoc Command Response Payload

Agent XMPP will map scalars, arrays and hashes returned by +execute+ blocks to jabber:x:data command 
response payloads (see XEP-0004 http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html for a description of jabber:x:data).

    execute 'scalar' do
      'scalar' 
    end

    execute 'hash' do
      {:a1 => 'v1', :a2 => 'v2'}
    end

    execute 'scalar_array' do
      ['v1', 'v2','v3', 'v4'] 
    end

    execute 'hash_array' do
      {:a1 => ['v11', 'v11'], :a2 => 'v12'}
    end

    execute 'array_hash' do
      [{:a1 => 'v11', :a2 => 'v12'}, 
       {:a1 => 'v21', :a2 => 'v22'}, 
       {:a1 => 'v31', :a2 => 'v32'}]
    end

    execute 'array_hash_array' do
      [{:a1 => ['v11', 'v11'], :a2 => 'v12'}, 
       {:a1 => ['v21', 'v21'], :a2 => 'v22'}, 
       {:a1 => ['v31', 'v31'], :a2 => 'v32'}]
    end

a +params+ structure is available within the +execute+ block containing routing information.

== Send Command

Commands may be sent with or without a response callback,

    command(:to=>'thatapp@a-place.com/ahost', :node=> 'hello') do |status, data|
      puts "COMMAND RESPONSE: #{status}, #{data.inspect}"
    end

    command(:to=>'thatapp@a-place.com/ahost', :node=> 'bye')

and within +execute+ blocks.

    execute 'hash_hello' do
      command(:to=>params[:from], :node=> 'hello') do |status, data|
        puts "COMMAND RESPONSE: #{status}, #{data.inspect}"
      end
      {:a1 => 'v1', :a2 => 'v2'}
    end

== Publish

Publish nodes are configured in +agent_xmpp.yml+.

    jid: myapp@nowhere.com
    password: pass
    roster:
        - 
            jid:you@home.com
        - 
            jid: someone@somewhere.com
    publish:
        - 
            node: time
            title: "Curent Time"   
        - 
            node: alarm
            title: "Alarms"   

The nodes are created if they do not exist and publish methods are generated for each node.

    publish_time('The time is:' + Time.now.to_s)
    
    publish_alarm({:severity => :major, :description => "A really bad failure"})

Publish nodes discovered that are not in +agent_xmpp.yml+ will be deleted. The following options

== Publish Options

The following publish options are available with the indicated default values. The options may be changed in
+agent_xmpp.yml+.

    :title                    => 'event',
    :access_model             => 'presence',
    :publish_model            => 'publishers',
    :max_items                => 20,
    :deliver_notifications    => 1,
    :deliver_payloads         => 1,
    :persist_items            => 1,
    :subscribe                => 1,
    :notify_config            => 0,
    :notify_delete            => 0,
    :notify_retract           => 0,

See http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html#registrar-formtypes-config for a detailed description.

== Subscribe

Declare +event+ blocks in +myapp.rb+ to subscribe to published events .

    # myapp.rb
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'agent_xmpp'

    event 'someone@somewhere.com', 'time' do
      message(:to=>'someone@somewhere.com', :body=>"Got the event at: " + Time.now.to_s)
    end

Agent XMPP will verify subscription to the event and subscribe if required. Subscriptions
discovered that are not declared by an event block in +myapp.rb+ will be deleted.

== Receive Chat Messages

Declare +chat+ blocks in +myapp.rb+ to receive and respond to chat messages.
  
    # myapp.rb
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'agent_xmpp'

    chat do
      params[:body].reverse
    end

If the +chat+ block returns a +String+ a response will be sent to the message sender.

== Send Chat Messages

    message(:to=>'thatapp@a-place.com/ahost', :body=>"Hello from #{AgentXmpp.jid.to_s} at " + Time.now.to_s)
    
== Roster

Roster groups may be specified in +agent_xmpp.yml+.

    jid: myapp@nowhere.com
    password: pass
    roster:
        - 
            jid:you@home.com
            groups: [good group, owners]
        
        - 
            jid: someone@somewhere.com
            groups: [bad group]
     
Agent XMPP will update the roster maintained on the XMPP server to be consistent with to the roster specified in +agent_xmpp.yml+. 

== Routing Priority

The routing priority may be configured in +agnet_xmpp.yml+. The default value is 1. Valid values are -127

    jid: myapp@nowhere.com
    password: pass
    priority: 128
    roster:
        - 
            jid:you@home.com
            groups: [good group, owners]
    
See http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3921.html for a details.
    
== Major Event Callbacks

Agent XMPP provides callbacks for applications to respond to major events that occur during execution.
 
    # application starting
    before_start{}

    # connected to server
    after_connected{|connection|}

    # client restarts when disconnected form server
    restarting_client{|connection|}
    
    # a pubsub node was discovered at service
    discovered_pubsub_node{|service, node|}
    
    # command nodes were discovered at jid
    discovered_command_nodes{|jid, nodes|}

    # a presence message of status :available or :unavailable was received from jid
    received_presence{|from, status|}
    
== Authentication
    
* Basic SASL

== Development with XMPP Clients

Ad-Hoc Commands, jabber:x:data Forms nor Service Discovery are widely supported by XMPP clients and Publish-Subscribe 
is not supported by any client. Gajim http://www.gajim.org provides support for Ad-Hoc Commands and jabber:x:data Forms. Service Discovery,
which is useful for Publish-Subscibe development, is supported by Gajim, but Psi http://psi-im.org provides a much better
implementation. Both Gajim and Psi provide an interface for manual entry of XML messages which is currently required for Publish-Subscribe development.

== Logging

By default log messages are written to STDOUT. A log file can be specified with the -l option.

        ruby mybot.rb -l file.log

The logger can be accessed and configured.
        
        before_start do
          AgentXmpp.logger.level = Logger::WARN 
        end

== Message Processing Callbacks

Message processing callbacks are available to applications to extend the message processing work flow. To receive
callbacks a delegate object must be provided that implements the callbacks of interest.   

    after_connected do |connection|
      connection.add_delegate(YourDelegate)
    end

The available callback methods are,
